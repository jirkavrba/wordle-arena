## 1. Fork this repo

Make a fork for this repo and create a new branch.
You can name it whatever, but `some-bot` makes sense.

## 2. Create the bot

Duplicate the folder `/src/bots/template` and change its name.
Then also rename `CustomSolverBotTemplate.ts` and the class inside it.

The file [CustomSolverBotTemplate.ts](../src/bots/template/CustomSolverBotTemplate.ts) has comments that will guide you.

Don't forget the `_about()` method!

## 3. Add and test your bot

After you are finished, add you bot inside the `/src/bots/bots.ts` file like so:
```ts
export const createAllBots = (wordle: Wordle): ASolverBot[] => {
  return [
    // ...previous bots
    new YourBot(wordle), // like so
  ];
};
```

Don't forget to test run it:
```bash
npm run start
```

Also make sure that you have correct linting and types:
```bash
npm run lint
```

## 4. Document your bot

Update the `README.md` file inside your bot folder. Describe it to as much details as you want.

You can also edit the root [README.md](../README.md#bots) and add your bot in the **Bots** section.

## 5. Make a PR

To submit your bot, make a pull request to the `main` branch.

That's it! :)
